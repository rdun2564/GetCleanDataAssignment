# GetCleanDataAssignment
GetCleanDataAssignment John Hopkins
The purpose of this project was to apply Tidy Data Principles to a source of data.
I describe the data methods used to create a tidy dataset collected from Samsung wearable devices that 
systematically recorded linear and angular movement over time using R functions.  The dataset used was obtained from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This data files contained within the zip file were manipulated to create a single dataframe containing variables of measured 
average linear and angular velocities (along with measures of their standard deviation) variables from each activity 
for each of the 30 subjects.  
The details of the version of R, the R packages used, the script, the data files manipulated and the variables names 
are documented in the attached Codebook file.
